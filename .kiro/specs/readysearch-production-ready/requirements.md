# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing ReadySearch automation tool into a production-ready application that allows users to enter custom names manually, import them from CSV or JSON files, and perform automated searches on https://www.readysearch.com.au/wizard. The system should provide real-time feedback, comprehensive result tracking, and multiple export options while maintaining robust error handling and user-friendly interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Manual Name Entry Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually enter names one by one through a web interface, so that I can quickly search for individual names without creating files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a text input field for entering names
2. WHEN the user enters a name and clicks "Add" THEN the system SHALL add the name to the search queue and display it in the list
3. WHEN the user enters an empty or invalid name THEN the system SHALL display a validation error message
4. WHEN the user wants to remove a name from the queue THEN the system SHALL provide a delete button for each name
5. WHEN the user has added names manually THEN the system SHALL allow them to start the automation process

### Requirement 2: CSV File Import Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import names from a CSV file, so that I can process large lists of names efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a CSV file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and display preview of names
2. WHEN the CSV file has a "name" column THEN the system SHALL extract names from that column
3. WHEN the CSV file has no "name" column THEN the system SHALL use the first column as names
4. WHEN the CSV file contains invalid or empty rows THEN the system SHALL skip them and report the count
5. WHEN the CSV import is successful THEN the system SHALL display all imported names in the queue
6. WHEN the CSV file is malformed THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with guidance

### Requirement 3: JSON/Array Import Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import names from JSON files or arrays, so that I can integrate with other systems that export JSON data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a JSON file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the JSON structure
2. WHEN the JSON contains an array of strings THEN the system SHALL treat each string as a name
3. WHEN the JSON contains an array of objects with "name" properties THEN the system SHALL extract the name values
4. WHEN the JSON structure is invalid THEN the system SHALL display a descriptive error message
5. WHEN the JSON import is successful THEN the system SHALL add all valid names to the search queue

### Requirement 4: ReadySearch.com.au Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically search each name on ReadySearch.com.au/wizard, so that I can get accurate search results without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the automation THEN the system SHALL navigate to https://www.readysearch.com.au/wizard
2. WHEN searching for each name THEN the system SHALL enter the name in the search field and submit the search
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze the results for exact matches
4. WHEN pop-ups or modals appear THEN the system SHALL automatically handle and dismiss them
5. WHEN a search fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
6. WHEN all retries fail THEN the system SHALL mark the search as "Error" and continue with the next name

### Requirement 5: Real-time Search Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress of the automation, so that I can monitor the status and know when it will complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the automation is running THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar showing completion percentage
2. WHEN processing each name THEN the system SHALL highlight the current name being searched
3. WHEN a search completes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the result status (Match/No Match/Error)
4. WHEN the user wants to stop the automation THEN the system SHALL provide a "Stop" button that gracefully halts the process
5. WHEN the automation completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all results

### Requirement 6: Result Classification and Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear results for each search indicating whether a match was found, so that I can quickly identify successful matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a name is found in search results THEN the system SHALL mark it as "Match" with a green indicator
2. WHEN a name is not found in search results THEN the system SHALL mark it as "No Match" with a gray indicator
3. WHEN a search encounters an error THEN the system SHALL mark it as "Error" with a red indicator and error details
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show timestamps for each search completion
5. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options to view only matches, no matches, or errors

### Requirement 7: Export and Download Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export search results in multiple formats, so that I can use the data in other applications or for reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide a "Download CSV" button
2. WHEN downloading CSV THEN the system SHALL include columns for name, status, timestamp, and error details
3. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide a "Download JSON" button with structured data
4. WHEN exporting matches only THEN the system SHALL provide an option to download only successful matches
5. WHEN no results exist THEN the system SHALL disable download buttons and show appropriate messaging

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Settings

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure automation settings like delays and timeouts, so that I can optimize performance for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display configurable options for search delays, timeouts, and retries
2. WHEN the user changes delay settings THEN the system SHALL validate the values are within acceptable ranges (1-10 seconds)
3. WHEN the user changes timeout settings THEN the system SHALL validate the values are reasonable (10-60 seconds)
4. WHEN the user enables headless mode THEN the system SHALL run browser automation without visible windows
5. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL save them for future sessions

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry the operation and log the error details
2. WHEN the ReadySearch website is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and pause automation
3. WHEN browser crashes occur THEN the system SHALL restart the browser and continue from the last processed name
4. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL display specific validation messages
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL save partial results and allow the user to resume later

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle large lists of names efficiently, so that I can process hundreds or thousands of names without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large lists THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to respect the target website
2. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL optimize data structures and clean up resources
3. WHEN processing takes a long time THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion times
4. WHEN the browser becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL detect and restart it automatically
5. WHEN processing very large files THEN the system SHALL implement chunked processing to maintain responsiveness
