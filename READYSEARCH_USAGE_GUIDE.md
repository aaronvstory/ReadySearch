python enhanced_cli.py

# Batch mode  
python enhanced_cli.py "name1;name2,1980;name3,1990"

# With flags
python enhanced_cli.py --batch "john smith,1980"
```

### 2. Optimized Batch CLI (High Performance)

**Best For**: 10-100+ searches, maximum performance

**Features**:
- ⚡ Browser connection pooling (3-5x faster)
- ⚡ Concurrent processing (up to 5 parallel searches)
- ⚡ Intelligent resource management
- ⚡ 70-90% performance improvement for batches
- ✅ Same accuracy as current system

**Usage**:
```bash
# Small batch (auto-optimized: 2 browsers, 2 concurrent)
python optimized_batch_cli.py "name1;name2,1980;name3"

# Large batch (auto-optimized: 5 browsers, 5 concurrent)  
python optimized_batch_cli.py "name1;name2;...;name100"
```

### 3. Production CLI (Original System)
**File**: `production_cli.py`
**Best For**: Simple command-line use, integration testing

**Features**:
- ✅ Reliable and tested
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ⚠️ Sequential processing

## 📝 Input Formats

### Name Formats
```bash
# Single name
"John Smith"

# Name with birth year
"John Smith,1990"

# Multiple names (semicolon-separated)
"John Smith;Jane Doe,1985;Bob Jones"

# Mixed formats
"John Smith;Jane Doe,1985;Bob Jones,1975;Mary Wilson"
```

### Birth Year Logic
- **Input**: `1990` → **Search Range**: 1988-1992 (±2 years)
- **Purpose**: Accounts for data entry variations and approximate ages

### Batch Size Recommendations

| Batch Size | Recommended System | Expected Duration | Performance |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1-3 names | Enhanced CLI | 8-25 seconds | Optimal |
| 4-10 names | Enhanced CLI | 30-80 seconds | Good |
| 11-25 names | Optimized Batch CLI | 45-120 seconds | Excellent |
| 26-50 names | Optimized Batch CLI | 90-300 seconds | Excellent |
| 51-100 names | Optimized Batch CLI | 180-600 seconds | Excellent |
| 100+ names | Contact for custom solution | Variable | Custom |

## ⚡ Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Choose Right System
- **≤10 searches**: Enhanced CLI (rich interface)
- **>10 searches**: Optimized Batch CLI (performance)

### 2. Batch Size Optimization
- **Sweet Spot**: 15-30 names per batch
- **Maximum Efficient**: 50 names per batch  
- **Large Batches**: Split into multiple runs

### 3. System Resources
- **Memory**: ~200MB per browser instance
- **CPU**: Moderate during processing
- **Network**: Requires stable internet connection

### 4. Rate Limiting Awareness
- ReadySearch.com.au may have rate limits
- System includes intelligent delays
- Large batches spread requests over time

---

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Browser Settings
```python
# In optimized_batch_cli.py
browser = await p.chromium.launch(
    headless=True,  # Set False for debugging
    args=['--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage', '--disable-gpu']
)
```

### Concurrency Settings
```python
# Adjust based on your system capabilities
pool_size = 3      # Number of browser instances
max_concurrent = 3 # Parallel searches
```

### Timeouts
```python
# Navigation timeout
timeout=15000  # 15 seconds

# Results loading timeout  
timeout=30000  # 30 seconds
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Browser launch failed"
**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify Playwright installation: `pip install playwright`
- Install browser binaries: `playwright install chromium`

#### 2. "No results found" (but should have results)
**Solutions**:
- Check name spelling
- Try without birth year
- Verify ReadySearch website accessibility

#### 3. "Memory error" (large batches)
**Solutions**:
- Use Optimized Batch CLI instead of Enhanced CLI
- Reduce batch size
- Restart system to clear memory

#### 4. Slow performance
**Solutions**:
- Use Optimized Batch CLI for batches >5
- Check network connection speed
- Reduce concurrent searches in optimization settings

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with detailed logging
python enhanced_cli.py "test name" --verbose

# Check browser interaction (non-headless)
# Edit code to set headless=False
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check system resources during execution
# Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac)

# Monitor network usage
# Ensure stable connection for best performance
```
